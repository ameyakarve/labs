   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This rant has been coming for a long time. I am finished with placements at college, and the best part about it is that it is over for me. It has become a part of the society, but placements are not a healthy situation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Downloading slides from SpeakerDeck</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was doing this course at college, where the professor decided to make the finals an open-book exam. He puts his slides up on SpeakerDeck. So, like I needed to figure out a way to get them printed without too much of a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I opened up the Networks tab on my Chrome explorer, I figured out that the SpeakerDeck widget actually loads the slides as image files; all I needed to do now was to find a pattern and systematically get all the images. Whenever I hit the next button, the widget made an XHR to the image file of the next slide and fetched it. The URL looked something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://speakerd.s3.amazonaws.com/presentations/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/slide_1.jpg?yyyyyyyyyyyyyy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all I had to do was to write a quick Shell script, and the files were all mine. The final script was something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; wget &#39;https://speakerd.s3.amazonaws.com/presentations/xxx/slide_&#39;$i&#39;.jpg?yyy&#39;; end;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is a function for Fish Shell. You could as well write a corresponding Bash script easily enough. Also, the numbering starts from 0; 10 slides means 0-9.&lt;/p&gt;
